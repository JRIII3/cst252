	<h2> Challenges </h2>
	<p> I didn't have much challenge in this lab </p>
	<h2> Problems </h2>
	<p> The only small problem I had in my lab was trying to figure out how to
		indent the pseudocode properly </p>
	<h2> Results </h2>
	<p> Below is my pseudocode </p>
	<pre> //Find a safe place to park/stop
	  //Turn on hazard lights if parked on side of the road
	    //Grab materials/ tools needed
	      //Jack the car up
	        //Remove bolts off tire
	          //Remove tire
	            //Grab spare tire
	            //Add bolts on spare tire
	          //Jack the car down
	        //Tighten bolts and check tire pressure
	      //Put away materials/ tools
	    //Put away damaged tire
	    //Drive away </pre>
