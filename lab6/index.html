		<h2> Challenges: </h2>
		<p> It is much easier and common to have certain errors and make
		  	mistakes in Javascript in compared to HTML and CSS but that is what
				I feel like makes this whole thing fun.</p>
		<h2> Problems: </h2>
		<p> I ran into many simple errors that would hold me back such as
				missing commas, quotes, and semicolons.</p>
		<h2> Results: </h2>
		<p> My page now works as intended.</p>
