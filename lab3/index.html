	<h2> Subject </h2>
	<p> The subject of this lab was to understand file structure and
		understanding the importance of having organized files.</p>
	<h2> Difficulties </h2>
	<p> The only real difficulty I had in this lab was getting my image to show
		up on the server. I solved this issue by remebering that my "jpg" should
		be lowercased.</p>
	<h2> Results </h2>
	<p> My image now shows on the web and my page looks good!</p>
